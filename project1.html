          <p>
            <b> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who was also known as Mahatma</b>,
            "Great Soul" Gandhi, was a hero, as well as a political and
            spiritual leader of India. He was of the Hindu faith, of which I am
            too. Mohandas brought India to independence by using non-violent
            resistance. He thought that there was injustice being served to the
            Indians, especially to the immigrants by the South Africans. Gandhi
            was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, Kathiawar, now known as
            Gujarat. Gandhi passed away at the age of 78 on January 30, 1948.
            Mahatma Gandhi was brought up in India near Rajkot, where he did
            most of his studies. In 1888, Gandhi went to London, leaving his
            wife and son behind, to pursue his degree in law. Later in 1893,
            Gandhi went to South Africa to work and found that there was a lot
            of prejudice towards Indians. That was the reason Gandhi began
            protesting and eventually he became an inspiring hero for millions.
            The three main qualities that define Gandhi as a hero are his strong
            leadership, simplicity and bravery.
